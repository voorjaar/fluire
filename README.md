## Story

> I have been using Google Calendar before, and then I felt that it was not too smooth to use, perhaps the main reason is that the recommended time gives me very little control, and the schedule changes frequently, which I dislike. So I decided to write a calendar by myself. Fhluire calendar is mainly based on personal habits and will have the following features.

- I like the feature that Google Calendar can drag each item freely, usually I am used to set a fixed schedule for a period of time, however, often due to various things can not be carried out on time, so allow dragging to any time, and can be completed within the same day is one of the most important features to me.

- The schedule should be combined with todo list, and after each thing completed requires some incentive, which also makes it easier to stick to it. Double click on the agenda to quickly complete the item.

- Combined with todo list, some things may not be recurring tasks, so just put them in the bottom left corner as a task list. When it needs to be done, drag it to the timeline.

- Each schedule should have a corresponding clock enabled, which can be enabled at the start of the schedule.

- There should be both timeline and schedule display options, which can be selected as needed.
